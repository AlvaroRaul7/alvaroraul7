### Hey! I'm [@alvaroraul7](Alvaro Valarezo) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Ecuador. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨

I have been in technology since I was 13 years old 

I started with really talented people:

#### The first influencer-marketing platform for Latin America

- [Publifyer](https://www.publifyer.com/es/) 

#### The first e-learning platform for entrepeneurs 

- [E-learning platform](https://epico.gob.ec/ce/auth/login/home )


Currently building:

- [Get It](https://www.get.it/)



I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Docker, Python, Go and Kubernetes

I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to Get It and my own startup. At the same time, I'm also helping the city where I live (Guayaquil,Ecuador) to create technology that helps people. If you would like to have my help with your team and product, feel free to **contact me**. ðŸ¤“

If my open source projects are useful for your **product/company** , feel free to use them.
